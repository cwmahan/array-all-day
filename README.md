# Array All Day ðŸ˜Ž
Sick of things not being arrays? Us too.

## The Mission
`array-all-day` is a comprehensive, _zero dependency_, blazing fast
array type-casting library (not a framework).

## Contribution Guidelines
Must love arrays.

## Config
Simply drop an `.array-all-day.rc.js` file into your root
directory, and it will do absolutely nothing... as expected.
